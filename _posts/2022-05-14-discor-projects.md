We will run project sessions on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/DXnfBUG">Discord Server</a> every 3 weeks or so.

Our first project will be to build a ***ProxMox sandbox*** - that means, we will add a virtual network with a ***graphical client*** running in a Linux container plus a ***VM running an OpenWrt image***.

This way you can use ProxMox to run a "virtual LAN" and do LAN-WAN tests such as access your virtual LAN from the outside using a VPN. You may use it to test software, to do ry-runs of WAN configurations and so on.
