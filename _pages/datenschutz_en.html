	<h3 class="western" align="left"><a id="m13"></a>Relevant legal
	bases</h3>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">The
	following is an overview of the legal basis of the GDPR on which we
	process personal data. Please note that in addition to the
	provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may
	apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. If, in
	addition, more specific legal bases are relevant in individual
	cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection
	declaration.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Consent
		(Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a. GDPR) </strong>- The data subject has
		given his/her consent to the processing of personal data concerning
		him/her for a specific purpose or purposes.</p></li>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Contract
		performance and pre-contractual requests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit.
		b. GDPR) </strong>- Processing is necessary for the performance of
		a contract to which the data subject is a party or for the
		performance of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject's
		request.</p></li>
		<li><p class="western" align="left"><strong>Legitimate interests
		(Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f. GDPR) </strong>- Processing is necessary
		for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a
		third party, unless such interests are overridden by the interests
		or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which
		require the protection of personal data.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="western" align="left"><a id="m27"></a>Security measures</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">We take
	appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level
	of protection appropriate to the risk in accordance with the legal
	requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the
	implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and
	purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities
	of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and
	freedoms of natural persons.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">The
	measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality,
	integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and
	electronic access to the data as well as the access, input,
	transfer, safeguarding of availability and its separation.
	Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise
	of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to
	data compromise. Furthermore, we take the protection of personal
	data into account as early as the development or selection of
	hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of
	data protection, through technology design and through data
	protection-friendly default settings.</p>
	<h2 class="western" align="left"><a id="m25"></a>Transmission of
	personal data</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">In the
	course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the
	data is transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies,
	legally independent organizational units or persons. The recipients
	of this data may include, for example, service providers
	commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that
	are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the
	legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate
	contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the
	recipients of your data.</p>
	<h2 class="western" align="left"><a id="m24"></a>Data processing
	in third countries</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">If we
	process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union
	(EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes
	place in the context of the use of third-party services or the
	disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or
	companies, this will only be done in accordance with the legal
	requirements.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">Subject to
	express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we
	only process or have data processed in third countries with a
	recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation through
	so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the
	presence of certifications or binding internal data protection
	regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information page of the EU
	Commission:

	<h2 class="western" align="left"><a id="m134"></a>Cookies use</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">Cookies
	are text files that contain data from visited websites or domains
	and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie is
	primarily used to store information about a user during or after his
	visit within an online offer. Stored information may include, for
	example, language settings on a website, login status, a shopping
	cart, or where a video was watched. The term cookies also includes
	other technologies that perform the same functions as cookies (e.g.,
	when user information is stored using pseudonymous online
	identifiers, also referred to as &quot;user IDs&quot;).</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><strong>The
	following cookie types and functions are distinguished:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Temporary
		cookies (also: session cookies):</strong> Temporary cookies are
		deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and
		closed his browser.</p></li>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Permanent
		cookies: </strong>Permanent cookies remain stored even after the
		browser is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or
		preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a
		website again. Likewise, the interests of users used for reach
		measurement or marketing purposes can be stored in such a cookie.</p></li>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>First-party
		cookies: </strong>First-party cookies are set by us.</p></li>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Third-party
		cookies (also: third-party cookies)</strong>: Third-party cookies
		are mainly used by advertisers (so-called third parties) to process
		user information.</p></li>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Necessary
		(also: essential or absolutely necessary) cookies: </strong>Cookies
		may be absolutely necessary for the operation of a website (e.g. to
		store logins or other user inputs or for security reasons).</p></li>
		<li><p class="western" align="left"><strong>Statistics, marketing
		and personalization cookies</strong>: Furthermore, cookies are
		generally also used in the context of range measurement and when a
		user's interests or behavior (e.g. viewing certain content, using
		functions, etc.) on individual websites are stored in a user
		profile. Such profiles are used, for example, to show users content
		that matches their potential interests. This process is also
		referred to as &quot;tracking&quot;, i.e., tracking the potential
		interests of users. Insofar as we use cookies or &quot;tracking&quot;
		technologies, we will inform you separately in our privacy policy
		or in the context of obtaining consent.</p></li>
	</ul>
	<p class="western" align="left"><strong>Notes on legal bases: The
	</strong>legal basis on which we process your personal data using
	cookies depends on whether we ask you for consent. If this is the
	case and you consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for
	processing your data is your declared consent. Otherwise, the data
	processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our
	legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online
	offer and its improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to
	fulfill our contractual obligations.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><strong>Storage
	period: </strong>If we do not provide you with explicit information
	about the storage period of permanent cookies (e.g. in the context
	of a so-called cookie opt-in), please assume that the storage period
	can be up to two years.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><strong>General
	information on revocation and objection (opt-out):</strong>
	Depending on whether the processing is based on consent or legal
	permission, you have the option at any time to revoke any consent
	you have given or to object to the processing of your data by cookie
	technologies (collectively referred to as &quot;opt-out&quot;). You
	can initially declare your objection by means of your browser
	settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (whereby this may
	also restrict the functionality of our online offer). An objection
	to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be
	declared by means of a variety of services, especially in the case
	of tracking, via the websites <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">https://optout.aboutads.info</a></u></span></font>
	and <font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a></u></span></font>.
	In addition, you can obtain further instructions on how to object in
	the context of the information on the service providers and cookies
	used.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><strong>Processing
	of cookie data based on consent</strong>: We use a cookie consent
	management procedure in which the consent of users to the use of
	cookies, or the processing and providers mentioned in the cookie
	consent management procedure, can be obtained and managed and
	revoked by users. In this context, the declaration of consent is
	stored in order not to have to repeat its request and to be able to
	prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The
	storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie
	(so-called opt-in cookie, or with the help of comparable
	technologies), in order to be able to assign the consent to a user
	or their device. Subject to individual information on the providers
	of cookie management services, the following information applies:
	The duration of the storage of consent can be up to two years. A
	pseudonymous user identifier is created and stored with the time of
	consent, information about the scope of consent (e.g., which
	categories of cookies and/or service providers), as well as the
	browser, system and end device used.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Types
		of data processed:</strong> Usage data (e.g. web pages visited,
		interest in content, access times), meta/communication data (e.g.
		device information, IP addresses).</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Data
		subjects:</strong> Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online

		<li><p class="western" align="left"><strong>Legal basis: </strong>Consent

	</ul>
	<h2 class="western" align="left"><a id="m225"></a>Provision of the
	online offer and web hosting</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">In order
	to provide our online offer securely and efficiently, we use the
	services of one or more web hosting providers from whose servers (or
	servers managed by them) the online offer can be accessed. For these
	purposes, we may use infrastructure and platform services, computing
	capacity, storage space and database services, as well as security
	services and technical maintenance services.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">The data
	processed within the scope of the provision of the hosting offer may
	include all information concerning the users of our online offer,
	which accrues within the scope of use and communication. This
	regularly includes the IP address, which is necessary to be able to
	deliver the contents of online offers to browsers, and all entries
	made within our online offer or from websites.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><strong>Collection
	of access data and log files</strong>: We ourselves (or our web
	hosting provider) collect data on each access to the server
	(so-called server log files). The server log files may include the
	address and name of the web pages and files accessed, the date and
	time of access, the volume of data transferred, notification of
	successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating
	system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule,
	IP addresses and the requesting provider.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">The server
	log files may be used, on the one hand, for security purposes, e.g.,
	to prevent server overload (especially in the case of abusive
	attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and, on the other hand, to ensure
	the utilization of the servers and their stability.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Types
		of data processed:</strong> Content data (e.g. entries in online
		forms), usage data (e.g. websites visited, interest in content,
		access times), meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP
		addresses).</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Data
		subjects:</strong> Users (e.g., website visitors, users of online
		services).</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left"><strong>Legal basis: </strong>Legitimate
		interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f. DSGVO).</p>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="western" align="left"><a id="m182"></a>Contact</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">When
	contacting us (e.g. by contact form, e-mail, telephone or via social
	media), the information of the inquiring persons is processed to the
	extent necessary to respond to the contact requests and any
	requested measures.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">The
	response to contact requests in the context of contractual or
	pre-contractual relationships is made in order to fulfill our
	contractual obligations or to respond to (pre)contractual inquiries
	and otherwise on the basis of legitimate interests in responding to
	the inquiries.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Types
		of data processed: </strong>inventory data (e.g. names, addresses),
		contact data (e.g. e-mail, telephone numbers), content data (e.g.
		entries in online forms).</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Affected
		persons:</strong> Communication partners.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Purposes
		of processing: </strong>contact requests and communication.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left"><strong>Legal basis: </strong>Contract
		fulfillment and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit.
		b. DSGVO), Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f.
		DSGVO).</p>
	</ul>
	<h2 class="western" align="left"><a id="m17"></a>Newsletter and
	electronic notifications</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">We send
	newsletters, e-mails and other electronic notifications (hereinafter
	&quot;newsletter&quot;) only with the consent of the recipients or a
	legal permission. Insofar as the contents of the newsletter are
	specifically described in the context of a registration, they are
	decisive for the consent of the users. Otherwise, our newsletters
	contain information about our services and us.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">To
	subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally sufficient to provide
	your e-mail address. However, we may ask you to provide a name, for
	the purpose of personal address in the newsletter, or further
	details, if these are required for the purposes of the newsletter.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><strong>Double
	opt-in procedure:</strong> Registration for our newsletter is always
	carried out in a so-called double opt-in process. This means that
	after registration you will receive an e-mail in which you are asked
	to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that
	no one can register with other e-mail addresses. The registrations
	for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to prove the
	registration process according to the legal requirements. This
	includes the storage of the registration and confirmation time as
	well as the IP address. Likewise, changes to your data stored with
	the shipping service provider are logged.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><strong>Deletion
	and restriction of processing: </strong>We may store unsubscribed
	email addresses for up to three years based on our legitimate
	interests before deleting them in order to be able to prove consent
	formerly given. The processing of this data will be limited to the
	purpose of a possible defense against claims. An individual request
	for deletion is possible at any time, provided that the former
	existence of consent is confirmed at the same time. In the event of
	obligations to permanently observe objections, we reserve the right
	to store the e-mail address in a block list (so-called &quot;block
	list&quot;) for this purpose alone.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">The
	logging of the registration process takes place on the basis of our
	legitimate interests for the purpose of proving its proper course.
	If we commission a service provider to send e-mails, this is done on
	the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure

	programs and affiliate links</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">We include
	so-called affiliate links or other references (which may include,
	for example, search masks, widgets or discount codes) to the offers
	and services of third-party providers in our online offer
	(collectively referred to as &quot;affiliate links&quot;). If users
	follow the Affiliate Links or subsequently take advantage of the
	offers, we may receive a commission or other benefits from those
	third parties (collectively, &quot;Commission&quot;).</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">In order
	to be able to track whether users have taken advantage of the offers
	of an affiliate link used by us, it is necessary that the respective
	third-party providers learn that users have followed an affiliate
	link used within our online offer. The assignment of the affiliate
	links to the respective business transactions or to other actions
	(e.g. purchases) serves the sole purpose of commission accounting
	and will be cancelled as soon as it is no longer necessary for the
	purpose.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">For the
	purposes of the aforementioned assignment of the affiliate links,
	the affiliate links can be supplemented by certain values that are a
	component of the link or can be stored otherwise, e.g. in a cookie.
	The values may include, in particular, the source website
	(referrer), the time, an online identifier of the operators of the
	website on which the affiliate link was located, an online
	identifier of the respective offer, the type of link used, the type
	of offer and an online identifier of the user.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%"><strong>Notes
	on legal bases: </strong>If we ask users for their consent to the
	use of third-party providers, the legal basis for the processing of
	data is consent. Furthermore, their use may be a component of our
	(pre)contractual services, provided that the use of the third-party
	providers has been agreed within this framework. Otherwise, user
	data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e.
	interest in efficient, economical and recipient-friendly services).
	In this context, we would also like to refer you to the information

	data in this context in order to communicate with users active there
	or to offer information about us.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">We would
	like to point out that user data may be processed outside the

	example, the enforcement of the users' rights could be made more
	difficult.</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">Furthermore,
	user data is usually processed within social networks for market
	research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can
	be created based on the usage behavior and resulting interests of
	the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to
	place advertisements within and outside the networks that presumably
	correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes,
	cookies are usually stored on the users' computers, in which the
	usage behavior and interests of the users are stored. Furthermore,
	data independent of the devices used by the users may also be stored
	in the usage profiles (especially if the users are members of the
	respective platforms and are logged in to them).</p>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">For a
	detailed presentation of the respective forms of processing and the
	options to object (opt-out), we refer to the privacy statements and

	most effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access
	to the users' data and can take appropriate measures and provide
	information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.</p>

	arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Right
		to object: You have the right to object at any time, on grounds
		relating to your particular situation, to the processing of
		personal data concerning you which is carried out on the basis of
		Article 6(1)(e) or (f) DSGVO; this also applies to profiling based
		on these provisions. If the personal data concerning you is
		processed for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right
		to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning
		you for the purposes of such marketing; this also applies to
		profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.</strong></p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Right
		of revocation for consents:</strong> You have the right to revoke
		any consent you have given at any time.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Right
		of access: </strong>You have the right to request confirmation as
		to whether data in question is being processed and to obtain
		information about this data, as well as further information and a
		copy of the data in accordance with the legal requirements.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Right
		to rectification: In </strong>accordance with the law, you have the
		right to request that data concerning you be completed or that
		inaccurate data concerning you be rectified.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Right
		to erasure and restriction of processing: </strong>You have the
		right, in accordance with the law, to request that data relating to
		you be erased immediately or, alternatively, to request restriction
		of the processing of the data in accordance with the law.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Right

	<h2 class="western" align="left"><a id="m42"></a>Definitions</h2>
	<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 115%">This
	section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this
	privacy policy. Many of the terms are taken from the law and defined
	primarily in Art. 4 of the GDPR. The legal definitions are binding.
	The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily
	intended to aid understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Affiliate
		tracking:</strong> Affiliate tracking logs links that the linking
		websites use to direct users to websites with product or other
		offers. The operators of the respective linking websites may
		receive a commission if users follow these so-called affiliate
		links and subsequently take advantage of the offers (e.g. buy goods
		or use services). For this purpose, it is necessary for the
		providers to be able to track whether users who are interested in
		certain offers subsequently take advantage of them at the
		instigation of the affiliate links. It is therefore necessary for
		the functionality of affiliate links that they are supplemented
		with certain values that become part of the link or are stored
		elsewhere, e.g. in a cookie. The values include, in particular, the
		source website (referrer), the time, an online identifier of the
		operator of the website on which the affiliate link was located, an
		online identifier of the respective offer, an online identifier of
		the user as well as tracking-specific values, such as, for example,
		advertising material ID, affiliate ID and categorizations.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Personal
		data: </strong>&quot;Personal data&quot; means any information
		relating to an identified or identifiable natural person
		(hereinafter &quot;data subject&quot;); an identifiable natural
		person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in
		particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
		identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g.
		cookie) or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
		physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
		identity of that natural person.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Controller:
		a </strong>&quot;controller&quot; is the natural or legal person,
		public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with
		others determines the purposes and means of the processing of
		personal data.</p>
		<li><p class="western" align="left"><strong>Processing:
		</strong>&quot;Processing&quot; means any operation or set of
		operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by
		automatic means. The term is broad and includes virtually any
		handling of data, be it collection, analysis, storage, transmission
		or deletion.</p>
