## How it all started

In 2019, I had some friends at my home for a barbecue. Of course I gave them a tour of my house. I have a lot of tech and DIY stuff in my home (actually I have a 1m x 1m CNC Router at my basement, a lot of screens in the house, plus a lot of home automation things etc.)

A couple of days later, I am on the phone with one of my friends and during the conversation he says "Marc, with everything you have at home - you could start a YouTube channel. You could make videos for a year just by telling how to build the stuff you have at home".

You know how this story continues, right ? I had been thinking about starting my own YouTube channel before - but - you know, it's one of the things you would but .... Long story short, that was the birth of [my Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/onemarcfifty) and more generally speaking of my social media presence.

## Who am I?

51 year old male, German and French, married, father of a daughter and a son. We are trilingual (German, French, English). I have two labrador dogs. Studied Economics and Computer Science. Currently working as a presales engineer in the software industry. 

## What is my YouTube channel about?

The theme of the channel is "The Place for Digital DIY" - that's exactly what it is about. Do it yourself in a digital world. Be it micro controllers, networking, programming - you name it. Around this channel my goal is to build a community of similarily minded people. 

## How can you get in touch with me?

I'd love to hear from you - please leave me a comment on YouTube for my videos! If you want to talk to me, then the best way of getting hold of me is to [join my discord server](https://discord.com/invite/DXnfBUG) - chat with me and with hundreds of friendly people. We do weekly video/voice sessions there, so this is your opportunity to speak to me in person - every week!

## How to support ?

I do have a [Patreon Page](https://patreon.com/onemarcfifty) - many thanks to my patrons who help me keep this channel independent of sponsors.
